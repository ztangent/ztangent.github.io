In August 2025, I will be starting as an assistant professor in the National University of Singapore's [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/), and establishing a lab centered on **scaling cooperative intelligence** via rational, model-based AI engineering. To that end, I am recruiting PhD students, post-doctoral researchers, research assistants, and visiting students interested in any of the following topics:

- Modeling and engineering [human-like cooperative agents](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01991-9)
  - [Bayesian theory of mind](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0064) and [inverse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07532)
  - [Cooperative communication](https://www.problang.org/) and [language-based assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17930)
  - [Uncertainty-aware cooperative planning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3014629.3014637) for assistive agents
  - etc.
- [Cooperative infrastructure](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01170-0) for human-human and human-machine interactions
  - [Norm learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13399) for decentralized coordination
  - Normative reasoning and [contractualist AI alignment](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Cty2rSMut483QgBQ2/what-should-ai-owe-to-us-accountable-and-aligned-ai-systems)
  - Foundations of rational deliberation, negotiation, and justification
  - etc.
- Applications of rational cooperative AI
  - Safe and reliable web-browsing agents via [cooperative (inverse) planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17930)
  - Language-instructable AI co-players in video games
  - Safe and uncertainty-aware assistive robotics
  - etc.
- Probabilistic programming and model-based planning for [guaranteed safe AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06624)
  - Planning languages and representations for web-based AI agents
  - Multi-resolution world/agent modeling via probabilistic programs
  - Belief-space planning with symbolic/abstract belief representations
  - etc.

For a summary of my research interests and tastes, check out [the talk I gave for my PhD thesis defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT6vm2tdJTQ), or my [faculty research statement](2024-faculty-research-statement.pdf). See my [about page](/about) for mentees I have previously worked with.

If you are interested in working with me on these topics (or potentially others), please email **xuan [at] mit [dot] edu** sharing more about your interests and background! (If you're nervous about sending an email, Eugene Vinitsky has written [a great guide](https://www.eugenevinitsky.com/posts/coldemails/) on how to send a cold emails to researchers.)

For **prospective PhD students**, [the PhD program at NUS Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/pg/phdcs/application/) has *two intakes*: August (apply by 15 December the previous year) and January (apply by 15 June the previous year). For guidance on how to prepare a strong PhD application, the [MIT EECS Communication Lab has useful examples and advice](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/eecs/commkit/graduate-school-statement-of-purpose/).

The next application deadline is **15 June 2025**, so if you are interested in working with me from January 2026, please reach out soon, and also submit an application in the next month!
