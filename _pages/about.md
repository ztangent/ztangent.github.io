I am an incoming assistant professor in the National University of Singapore's [Department of Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/), starting in August 2025. I am currently recruiting PhD students, post-doctoral researchers, and research assistants — see the [recruiting page](/recruiting) for details!

Previously, I completed my PhD in the the MIT [Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/) and [Computational Cognitive Science lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/), advised by [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/) and [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh).

My research sits at the intersection of *Bayesian modeling*, *AI alignment*, and *cognitive science*, asking questions like:
- How can we specify rich yet structured generative models of human reasoning, decision-making, and value formation?<sup>[1][ref_sips],[2][ref_brbtom],[3][ref_clips],[4][ref_namg],[5][ref_beyond]</sup>
- How can we perform Bayesian inference over such models, in order to accurately learn human goals<sup>[1][ref_sips],[6][ref_hbtom],[7][ref_oesips]</sup>, values, and norms<sup>[4][ref_namg],[8][ref_bayesnorm]</sup>?
- How can we build AI systems that act reliably in accordance with these inferred goals<sup>[3][ref_clips]</sup> and norms<sup>[4][ref_namg]</sup>?

To answer these questions, my work includes the development of infrastructure for [probabilistic programming](https://www.gen.dev/)<sup>[9][ref_smcp3],[10][ref_genify]</sup> and [model-based planning](https://github.com/JuliaPlanners/PDDL.jl)<sup>[11][ref_pddljl],[12][ref_absint]</sup>, so as to enable fast and flexible Bayesian inference over complex models of agents and their environments. By developing engineering platforms for more auditable AI systems with stronger algorithmic guarantees, I hope to support the growth of [well-founded and human-compatible AI](https://youtu.be/mYOg8_iPpFg?t=924).

I am committed to promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in computer science, and to helping steer the development of AI towards beneficial and equitable outcomes for all. To those ends, I help to organize DEIJ groups such as [THRIVE at MIT](https://thrive-eecs.mit.edu/) and [Julia Gender Inclusive](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/announcing-julia-gender-inclusive/63702), and serve as a community council member of the [Collective Intelligence Project](https://cip.org/about).

I publish under the name "Tan Zhi-Xuan". This means an [APA citation](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date) should look like (Zhi-Xuan, YYYY). "Tan" is my surname (transliterated from Hokkien), "Zhi Xuan" is my given name (in Mandarin / pinyin), and "Xuan" (pronounced *ɕɥɛn / sh-yen*) is the name I usually go by.

## mentoring & teaching

I am fortunate to have worked with and mentored many Masters and junior PhD students over the course of my PhD, including Jordyn Mann (on neurosymbolic goal inference<sup>[13][ref_neurosym]</sup>), [Gloria Lin](https://gzlin7.github.io/) (on active structure learning for Gaussian Processes<sup>[14][ref_gpactive]</sup>), [Jovana Kondic](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CmAO43YAAAAJ&hl=en) (on inverse motion planning<sup>[15][ref_imp]</sup>), and [Lance Ying](https://scholar.harvard.edu/lanceying/home) (on integrating large language models with Bayesian theory-of-mind<sup>[16][ref_labtom]</sup>).

I have also served as a mentor for the [PIBBSS Summer Fellowship](https://pibbss.ai/fellowship/) from 2022 to 2024, working with [Zachary Peck](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/peckzy), [Mel Andrews](https://mel-andrews.com/), [Ninell Oldenburg](https://ninell-oldenburg.github.io/), and [Agustín Martinez Suñé](https://agusmartinez.ar/) on a range of topics across philosophy of AI, social norm learning<sup>[4][ref_namg]</sup>, and safety guarantees for LLM-based agents.

In Spring 2022, I was a teaching assistant for the graduate seminar on [Bayesian Modeling and Inference](https://tamarabroderick.com/course_6_435_2022_spring.html) taught by [Tamara Broderick](https://tamarabroderick.com/). As a TA, I supported students in understanding and presenting papers on variational inference, MCMC methods, and Bayesian non-parametrics, while providing guidance and debugging support for their course projects.
