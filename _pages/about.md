I am a PhD student in the MIT [Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/) and [Computational Cognitive Science lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/), advised by [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/) and [Josh Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh).

My research sits at the intersection of *Bayesian modeling*, *AI alignment*, and *cognitive science*, asking questions like:
- How can we specify rich yet structured generative models of human reasoning, decision-making, and value formation?
- How can we perform Bayesian inference over such models, in order to accurately learn human goals, values, and cooperative norms?
- How can we build AI systems that act reliably in accordance with these inferred goals and norms?

To answer these questions, my work includes the development of infrastructure for [probabilistic programming](https://www.gen.dev/) and [model-based planning](https://github.com/JuliaPlanners/PDDL.jl), so as to enable fast and flexible Bayesian inference over complex models of agents and their environments. By developing engineering platforms for more auditable AI systems with stronger algorithmic guarantees, I hope to support the growth of [well-founded and human-compatible AI](https://youtu.be/mYOg8_iPpFg?t=924).

I am committed to promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) in computer science, and to helping steer the development of AI towards beneficial and equitable outcomes for all. To those ends, I help to organize DEIJ groups such as [THRIVE at MIT](https://thrive-eecs.mit.edu/) and [Julia Gender Inclusive](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/announcing-julia-gender-inclusive/63702), and serve as a community council member of the [Collective Intelligence Project](https://cip.org/about).

I publish under the name "Tan Zhi-Xuan". This means an [APA citation](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date) should look like (Zhi-Xuan, YYYY). "Tan" is my surname (transliterated from Hokkien), "Zhi Xuan" is my given name (in Mandarin / pinyin), and "Xuan" (pronounced *ɕɥɛn / sh-yen*) is the name I usually go by.
